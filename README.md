Obs2Org is a cross platform command (works on *BSD, Linux, OS X and Windows) line program to convert [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) style Markdown files to [Org-Mode](https://orgmode.org/) files for Emacs and other Editors that support Org-Mode.

It converts the Markdown files using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) and afterwards corrects the links to headings in other Org-Mode files, converts the hash-tag style Obsidian tags to Org-Mode style tags and puts angle brackets around dates.

## Example

Obs2Org converts a Markdown file like to following:

```md
---
title: "Programming"
author:
  -
keywords:
  - Programming
tags:
  - Programming
lang: en
---
# Programming

Keywords: #Programming

## Installation

### Pandoc

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) is needed to do the actual conversion of Markdown files to Org-Mode files.

See [Installing pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) on how to install Pandoc for your OS.

### Obs2Org

#### Python, at Least Version 3.9

#### The PyPI Obs2Org Package

Install the PyPI (pip) package `obs2org` for all users on your computer as administrator/root:

- Linux, OS X:

    ```shell
    sudo pip install obs2org
    ```

- Windows:

   Open an administrator shell by writing `cmd` in the search field of the taskbar, ricght click on the command app and select "Run as Adminsitrator".
   in this shell execute:

   ```ps1
   pip install obs2org
   ```

## Usage

Use Obs2Org by running it as a normal user (**not** administrator or root) as Python module using

- Linux, OSX:

    ```shell
    python3 -m obs2org --version
    ```

- Windows

    ```ps1
    python -m obs2org --version
    ```

This should yield the version string like

```ps1
> python -m obs2org --version
obs2org 1.0.0
```

To get a text explaining the usage of Obs2Org, use the argument `--help` or the short form `-h`:

Windows:

```ps1
python -m obs2org --help
```

Linux, OS X:

```shell
python3 -m obs2org --help
```

Output:

```ps1
> python -m obs2org --help

usage: python -m obs2org [-h] [-V] [-p PANDOC] [-o OUT_PATH] [MARKDOWN_FILES ...]

Converts markdown formatted files to Org-Mode formatted files using Pandoc.

positional arguments:
  MARKDOWN_FILES        The path to the markdown files or directory to convert to
  ...
```

### Examples

These examples only work if Pandoc is in the PATH of your shell. If it isn't you can add the path to Pandoc by using the argument `--pandoc` or `-p`.

To set the path to Pandoc to `c:/pandoc/pandoc` add `--pandoc c:/pandoc/pandoc` or `-p c:/pandoc/pandoc` to each invocation of Obs2Org.

Example:

```ps1
python -m obs2org ./Markdown ../Org --pandoc c:/pandoc/pandoc
```

1. current directory

    ```ps1
    python -m obs2org
    ```

    Which is the same as

    ```ps1
    python -m obs2org ./
    ```

    Converts all markdown files with a suffix of `.md` in the current working
    directory and all its subdirectories to files in Org-Mode format with the
    same base filename but a `.org` suffix.

2. one file

    ```ps1
    python -m obs2org hugo.md -o sepp.org
    ```

    Converts the markdown document `hugo.md` to an Org-Mode document named
    `sepp.org`.

3. all files with extension `.md`

    ```ps1
    python -m obs2org *.md
    ```

    Converts all markdown files with a suffix of `.md` in the current working
    directory to files in Org-Mode format with the same base filename but a
    `.org` suffix.

4. convert files to given directory

    ```ps1
    python -m obs2org *.md ../Org
    ```

    Converts all markdown files with a suffix of `.md` in the current working
    directory to files in Org-Mode format with the same base filename but a
    `.org` suffix in the directory `../Org`.

5. convert files in given directory to other directory

    ```ps1
    python -m obs2org ./Markdown ../Org
    ```

    Converts all markdown files with a suffix of `.md` in the directory
    `./Markdown` and its subdirectories to files in Org-Mode format with
    the same base filename but a `.org` suffix in the directory `../Org`.

## Development

### Python, version > 3.9

You need Python 3.9 or newer.

### Setup

1. Run `pipenv install --dev` to install the Python environment in the project directory
2. Run `pipenv run pre-commit install` to install the pre commit hooks to git. Now every time you commit a change, the linters are run.

   - To run the pre commit checks manually: `pipenv run pre-commit run --all-files`

### Scripts

- [](./make_package.sh) - Linux, OS X: build the Obs2Org PyPI package
- [./make_package.bat](./make_package.bat) - Windows: build the Obs2Org PyPI package. This is disabled on Windows, because the scripts would not be executable because of the Windows filesystem.
- [./run_local_linters.sh](./run_local_linters.sh) - Linux, OS X: run all configured linters on the Source code and tests.
- [./run_local_linters.bat](./run_local_linters.bat) - Windows: run all configured linters on the Source code and tests.
- [./run_tests.sh](./run_tests.sh) - Linux, OS X: run all tests.
- [./run_tests.bat](./run_tests.bat) - Windows: run all tests.
